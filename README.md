# JJGOBOT
A cursed script in which I extract every Jordan, Jesse, Go episode's title and run it through an AI image generator

This is a simple iPython notebook that parses a podcast's RSS feed to extract episode titles and feeds them into deepai.org's image generator API.

The output is huge, so I've included the ouput folder here but add jpg's to the .gitignore so I don't use up all my free space there.  You can look at all the results at https://bit.ly/jjgobot
